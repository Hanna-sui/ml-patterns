### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We invite you to participate in the compilation of a library of **patterns** and **cases** of machine learning projects.

A **pattern** is a description of a common situation, its standard solution, plus a large explaining picture. The text is limited to 1000 characters. The difference between this collection and other materials on the web is that the information in it is presented as concisely as possible, only the essence. [An example of the design of the pattern](https://github.com/ml-patterns/ml-patterns/blob/main/index.md).

Various aspects of ML-related projects will be covered:

* mathematical
* technical
* devops
* QA
* managerial
* entrepreneurial
* personnel
* financial
* marketing and others

The format of the **case** is the same as that of the **pattern**: a picture, a description of the situation and its solution, plus (optionally) a link to the author and / or company. The difference between a **case** and a **pattern** is that a specific project is described in a **case**.

The project has a free [CC BY-SA license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) and is created by a team of authors.

The project is not for commercial purposes.

When 300 patterns are typed, a paper book will be released with an indication of all authors. Authors will receive free copies.

Thank you for your attention to the project!
